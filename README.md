# Netflix_Dashboard


Netflix is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world, with millions of users consuming hours of content every day. As a data analyst, I had the opportunity to dive into the world of Netflix and analyze some of the most important data points using Tableau.

Overall, my analysis of Netflix using Tableau allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how people are consuming content on the platform. By visualizing the data in various ways, I was able to identify trends and insights that I wouldn't have been able to see by looking at the raw data alone. As a data analyst, it was exciting to be able to dive into such a fascinating topic and use my skills to gain a deeper understanding of one of the world's most popular streaming platforms.
